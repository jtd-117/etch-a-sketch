A LIVE preview can be found [here](https://jtd-117.github.io/pixel-sketcher/).

'Pixel Sketcher' provides a blank canvas of pixels for users to draw on. Users can select a color to sketch with a single color or Nyan Cat (i.e. a random selection of colors), adjust the number of pixels on the canvas, & use the 'Eraser' to clear sections of their work.
